# Phishing Analysis Tools

## What I learned

- The first step when analyzing a suspicious email is to examine the email header and the email body.
- Different tools are used to analyze headers, check reputation, extract URLs, and safely analyze attachments.

## Tools

**Mail Header Analysis**

Tools such as Message Header (part of the Google Admin Toolbox) and Message Header Analyzer can be used to inspect and interpret email header data.

**IP and URL Reputation Analysis**

Several tools support reputation checks on IPs and URLs:

- **IPinfo** – gathers detailed information about an IP address
- **URLScan.io** – inspects and analyzes URLs
- **Cisco Talos IP & Domain Reputation Center** – assesses the reputation of IP addresses, domains, and networks

**URL Extraction**

URL extraction tools are used to identify and extract URLs embedded within email content.

**VirusTotal**

A widely used platform for analyzing the reputation of files, URLs, IP addresses, and domains.

**Attachment Handling**

Email attachments should only be analyzed within a sandbox environment. Available online malware sandbox tools include:

- **ANY.RUN**
- **Hybrid Analysis**
- **Joe Sandbox**

**PhishTool**

A platform designed specifically for phishing investigation and analysis.

## Key concepts

- Email header  
  → contains metadata like sender, route, and mail servers

- Reputation analysis  
  → checking whether IPs, domains, or files are known to be malicious

- Sandbox  
  → isolated environment used to safely analyze suspicious files

## Why it matters in SOC

- These tools help SOC analysts quickly identify malicious emails and prevent user compromise.
- Using multiple tools improves detection accuracy and reduces false positives.

## Commands / tools used

- Analyzed multiple suspicious emails using header analysis, reputation tools, and sandbox environments

## Personal notes

- Combining multiple tools gives a much clearer picture of whether an email is malicious or not.
- Attachments should never be opened directly and must always be analyzed safely.
